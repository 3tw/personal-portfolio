# Portfolio

I made my web portfolio using Vue.js and Vue router.

## Features

The portfolio features two reusable Vue components that are available in [VueComponents](https://github.com/3tw/VueComponents).

### LanguageChart
LanguageChart.vue utilizes axios to get data from a selected GitHub repository and transforms them into a chart of langugaes that were used inside that repository. It takes only one prop: the selected repository's url given through the parent comopontent.
