# Portfolio

I made my web portfolio using Vue.js and Vue router.

## Features

The portfolio features two reusable Vue components that are available in [VueComponents](https://github.com/3tw/VueComponents).

### LanguageChart
LanguageChart.vue utilizes axios to get data from a selected GitHub repository. It searches for languages inside the repository and displays the data via simple chart. It takes only one prop: the selected repository's url that is passed through the parent comopontent.
